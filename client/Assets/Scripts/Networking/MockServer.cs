//A mock server that should handle everything the server does, but by keeping information in static memory opposed to writing it to a database.
//This means that games will not persist in the testing environment, which i think should be okay.
//This should act identically to the server, meaning it receives the game state JSON string, parses it, creates a game state object and deals with it that way
